The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container div {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 20px; /* This will unexpectedly inherit font-size from .container div */
}
```

The issue is that the `p` element inside the `.container` inherits the `font-size` from the more specific `div` selector due to inheritance, even though it does not have a direct font size applied to it. This can lead to unexpected styling results.
